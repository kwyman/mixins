A Very Basic Set of Mixins to be used with SASS!
This was tailored to be used alongside HTML5 Boilerplate. As such, this does not
address or solve anything 'normalize.css' or the H5BP 'main.css' files already
do quite well.

mixins.sass
-Border Radius
-Placement
-Transform
-Rotate
-Scale
-Translate      
-Transition
-Linear Gradient
-Box Shadow
-Opacity (no solid color fallback included in the mixin)
-Background-Clip (adjusts border definitions so opacity reflects whatever's
beneath it, not the element the border/shadow belongs to.)

style.sass
-A simple template for starting a new style in SASS. It has a
simple hack to increase the clickable area of text links, Paul Irish's box-sizing 
trick, and a mixin-based setup for media queries. 

Thanks for looking! Feel free to use this as you please! If you improve on it,
please feel free to push it up to me!
